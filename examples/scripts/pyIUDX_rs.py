""" A python script example for using the ResourceServer class of pyIUDX SDK(https://github.com/iudx/pyIUDX)

This script allows the user to access the class-ResourceServer from python SDK for IUDX(pyIUDX)
This class can also be imported as a module and contains the following functions:
    *dispParams() - Display rs initalization parameter, returns: version string
    *getData(id, opts=None, token=None) - Get data from a resource server, returns: rs constructed url
    *getDataAfter(id, time, token=None) - Get data after a given time, returns: corresponding data as a list of dicts/dict
    *getDataAround(id, point, radius, token=None) - Get data around a specific point(lat, lon) and radius(meters), returns: corresponding data as a list of dicts/dict
    *getDataBefore(id, time, token=None) - Get data before a given time, returns: corresponding data as a list of dicts/dict
    *getDataDuring(id, startTime, endTime, token=None) - Get data during a time interval, returns: corresponding data as a list of dicts/dict
    *getDataValuesBetween(id, attribute, minVal, maxVal, token=None) - Get data of an item for which an attribute is between minVal and maxVal, returns: corresponding data as a list of dicts/dict
    *getDataValuesGreater(id, attribute, minVal, token=None) - Get data of an item for which an attribute is greater than minVal, returns: corresponding data as a list of dicts/dict
    *getDataValuesLesser(id, attribute, maxVal, token=None) - Get data of an item for which an attribute is lesser than maxVal, returns: corresponding data as a list of dicts/dict
    *getDataValuesLike(id, attribute, val, token=None) - Get data of an item for which an attribute is like value, returns: corresponding data as a list of dicts/dict
    *getLatestData(id, token=None) - Get latest data, returns: corresponding data as a list of dicts/dict
    *getStatus(id, token=None) - Get Status of a resource item, returns: corresponding data as a list of dicts/dict
    *getUrl() - Get rs constructed url, returns: rs constructed url
    *search(url, data) - Use requests library to make a search request, returns: Response body
